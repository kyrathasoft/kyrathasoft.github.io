Well, it took some doing, but I managed to install Ruby, then Jekyll and Bundle.
I was able to use the [Jekyll Quickstart Guide][jqg] to create a local website copy.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight html linenos %}

using System;

namespace HelloWorld {
    class Program {
        static void Main(){
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
